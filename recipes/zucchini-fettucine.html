        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>I know, I know. I know what you're thinking. <em>Another</em> pasta recipe?! I promise, I tried to think of something more creative, but in the end, I just couldn't stay away. What can I say? I told you I love pasta!</p>

        <p>Unlike the <a href="./egg-sauce-linguine.html">Egg Sauce Linguine</a> recipe, however, this fettucine is light, vegetable-heavy, and perfect for warm weather. While the Egg Sauce Linguine is probably our go-to winter pasta, this one is our go-to for summer. Like with the other recipe, my wife and I will often substitute spaghetti for the fettucine. Also, although the basil is listed as optional in the ingredients below, I cannot recommend it enough; it transforms the whole dish.</p>

        <p>Let the pasta-making commence!</p>

        <p>Fun fact: I don't think I actually have a fun fact for this one, sadly. I guess the fact that I've never made it myself? I should probably do that at some point. Beloved wife, if you're reading this, I apologize for slacking.</p>

        <p><em>Serves 2-3.</em></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>8 oz fettucine</li>
            <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp chile flakes</li>
            <li>2 small zucchini, finely diced</li>
            <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Romano or Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Sprinkling of finely chopped fresh basil (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Salt liberally to taste.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain the pasta just before it's finished (it will cook a tad further when later added to the vegetable pan).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 tbsp butter in a pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and chile flakes. Let them sizzle for 30 seconds to a minute, then add the zucchini. Stir the vegetables to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until some of the water has cooked off and the veggies are tender, 5-7 minutes (young summer zucchini doesn't need much cooking). Add the lemon zest. Stir.</li>
            <li>Drain the fettucine and add to the pan along with the remaining 3 tbsp butter, the cream, and most of the cheese. Toss the fettucine around the pan, and add salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper to taste. Top with a bit more cheese and a sprinkling of basil. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
