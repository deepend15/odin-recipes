        <h1>Mom's Homemade Chili</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
            
        <p>This is the recipe for the chili that my mom used to make for us when I was a kid. A quintessential winter indulgence, I have many a fond memory of coming inside after a day of play in the the brutal Northeast Ohio snowfall, and warming up to a heaping, hearty bowl of chili goodness.</p>

        <p>Like all good homemade recipes, my mom passed this recipe on to me on a tattered index card with ingredients only - there were no steps included in terms of actual, you know, cooking. Since I think the general idea is just "mix everything into a big pot and heat until it looks right," that's essentially what I've shoehorned into the "Steps" section here. Feel free to experiment on your own at this part, and do whatever feels right to you.</p>

        <p>I know some people who swear by eating their chili with cornbread. For us, chili was always served on top of white rice, so that would be my personal recommendation. Maybe add a sprinkling of cheddar cheese on top, and maybe eat with a few Saltines on the side for dipping/mixing. Idk, we were poor, okay?</p>

        <p>Fun fact: My mom actually won a chili cook-off at our church with this recipe when I was younger. I'm pretty sure I was the one who convinced her to enter, and I'm still upset over the fact that she didn't take me out to dinner with the restaurant gift card that she won as a prize.</p>
